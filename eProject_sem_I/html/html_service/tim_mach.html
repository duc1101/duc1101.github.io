            </h3>
            <p>
                Usually, cardiologists will only examine in the morning at Clinic 1 and not the day
                Every appointment has a schedule. Therefore, patients should go to the clinic early to catch up and
                read the results within
                morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Patients visit the website of Hanoi Medical University Hospital to look up the weekly schedule.
                Besides,
                You can also call the hospital hotline 19006422 to ask for a schedule and book a day in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                When booking in advance, patients will be scheduled to come for examination, but still take time to
                wait
                examination. However, it will also save a lot of time waiting for a visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that when the patient is examined, it is advisable to go straight to the clinic entrance
                located separate from the gate
                Medical University Hospital (Hanoi Medical University is located in the middle of Medical University
                Hospital and Clinic No. 1). IN
                There is space for motorbikes and cars for patients.
